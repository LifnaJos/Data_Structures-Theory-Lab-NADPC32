# Experiment  - 11 : Implement Sorting Techniques
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bucket Sort
## Theory :
- Quick Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
- Heap Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
- Bucket Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
## Program :
Implement the below Sorting techniques and calculate the number of comparisons and swapping required for 3 cases (Best case, Average case, Worst case)
1. Quick Sort
2. Heap Sort
3. Bucket Sort
## Output :
- Attach the output for all the cases defined as per the program implemented.
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Bucket Sort
- Implemented Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Bucket Sort.
