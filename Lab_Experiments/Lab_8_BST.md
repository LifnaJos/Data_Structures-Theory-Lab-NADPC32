# Experiment  - 4 : Implement a Binary Search Tree
## Theory :
- What is a Binary Search Tree?
- List all the operations to be performed on a Binary Search Tree.
- List 5 Applications of Binary Search Tree
- Write the algorithm for the following operations on Binary Search Tree with pictorial demonstrations
  1. Create a BST
  2. Insert an element into BST
  3. Delete an element from BST
  4. Inorder Traversal
  5. Postorder traversal
  6. Preorder Traversal
  7. Search an element in BST
## Program :
- Print out of complete program for Binary Search Tree with all the above operations 
## Output :
- Perform all the operartions in Binary Search Tree 
- Also display the status of Binary Search Tree  after each operation is performed
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Binary Search Tree 
- Implemented the operations of Binary Search Tree
