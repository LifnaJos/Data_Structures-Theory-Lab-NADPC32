# Experiment  - 10 : Implement Searching Technique
## Theory :
- Difference between Binary Search and Linear Search
- Enslist the 4 Hashing techniques with formula
## Program :
1. Implement Binary Search on a sorted array. Calculate the comparisons required in the following cases
   
   a. Search for a key in the array
   
   b. Search for a key not in the array
   
2. Declare an array of size 10 to define a Hash Table. Insert the keys K1 to K7 (3 digit values). Insert the elements into the Hash Table based on the Hashing functions and display the Hash Table. The program should conatin 4 functions given below.
   
   a. Division method, m = 10
   
   b. Multiplication method, A = 0.618
   
   c. Mid-square method, r = 1
   
   d. Folding method
   
   If there is a collision, keep track of the number of collisions and resolve them using Linear Probing.   
## Output :
- Attach the output for all the use cases defined as per the program implemented.
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Binary Searching & Hashing teechniques
- Implemented Binary Search alogorithm to search an element in a sorted Array
- Implemented Hashing Functions to map key values into Hash Table and resolved the collision using Linear Probing.
