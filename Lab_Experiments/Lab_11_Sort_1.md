# Experiment  - 11 : Implement Sorting Techniques
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
## Theory :
- Selection Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
- Merge Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
- Insertion Sort Algorithm with an example sceanrio
## Program :
Implement the below Sorting techniques and calculate the number of comparisons and swapping required for 3 cases (Best case, Average case, Worst case)
1. Selection Sort.
2. Merge Sort.
3. Insertion Sort.
## Output :
- Attach the output for all the cases defined as per the program implemented.
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Insertion Sort
- Implemented Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
