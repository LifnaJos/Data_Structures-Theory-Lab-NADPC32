# Experiment  - 4 : Implement a Singly Linked List
## Theory :
- What is a Singly Linked List?
- List all the operations to be performed on a Singly Linked List.
- List 5 Applications of Singly Linked List
- Write the algorithm for the following operations on Singly Linked List with pictorial demonstrations
  1. Insert at the Beginning
  2. Insert at the End
  3. Insert at a specific position
  4. Insert After a given node
  5. Insert Before a given node
  6. Search an element in the list
  7. Traverse through the list and display elements
  8. Delete at the Beginning
  9. Delete at the End
  10. Delete a specific element
  11. Delete After a given node
  12. Delete Before a given node
## Program :
- Print out of complete program for Singly Linked List with all the above operations 
## Output :
- Attach Output considering underflow conditions in Singly Linked List
- Perform all the operartions in Singly Linked List
- Also display the status of Singly Linked List after each operation is performed
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Singly Linked List
- Implemented the operations of Singly Linked List
