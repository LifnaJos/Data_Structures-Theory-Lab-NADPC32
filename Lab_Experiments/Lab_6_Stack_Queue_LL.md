# Experiment  - 6 : Implement Stack and Linear Queue using Linked List.
## Theory :
- Differentiate between Stack and Queue
- Differentiate between Array and LinkedList
- Algorithm for Push and Pop in Stack using LinkedList
- Algorithm for Enqueuq and Dequeue in Queue using LinkedList
## Program :
- Print out of complete program for Stack and Queue using LinkedList
## Output :
- Attach Output considering underflow in both Stack and Queue using LinkedList
- Also display the status of Stack and Queue after each operation is performed
## Conclusion :
- Understood the concept of Stack and Queue implementation using LinkedList
- Implemented the operations of Stack and Queue using LinkedList
